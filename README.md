# Sorting-Visualizer

The idea is to create a visual representation of how the various known sorting algorithms actually work. 

Since the algorithms are written with a certain image in mind, I aim to use basic web designing tools to bring that image to life and be able to explain visually how sorting works. 

The webpage is coded with HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language, Version 5), JavaScript, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). 

The physical elements of the webpage (buttons and layout) are coded with very minimal HTML5 code. T

he next biggest contributor would be the CSS code, which is responsible for the appearance and behavior of the buttons and text. 
Finally, the rest is devoted to JavaScript, responsible for the histogram generation, movement and algorithm design. 

All the buttons refer to designated parts of the JavaScript code to perform the task.
